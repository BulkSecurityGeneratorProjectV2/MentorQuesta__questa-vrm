    <b>VRMDATA Directory</b>
    <p>Specify the location of where the regression results will be stored.  By default, VRM creates a
    directory called <em>VRMDATA</em> which will be located in the CWD where the regression is invoked.
    Alternatively this can be overridden by specifying a directory upon invocation as follows:</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>vrun -vrmdata &lt;my_directory&gt; ...</em></p>
